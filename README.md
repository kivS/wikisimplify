When accessing a wikipedia article, like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy, we can get a simplified version of it
by changing the url to https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy. If available, Wikipedia will display the simplified version in plain English.
This browser extension simply toggles the article between simplified and normal mode.
